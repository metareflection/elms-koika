/**
 * A helper trait for defining analyses over a Language with an expression type E.
 *
 * This trait leverages the Language's ability to construct an expression E from
 * its analysis nodes, allowing you to write your analysis logic directly
 * in terms of E rather than the raw analysis node structure.
 *
 * To use this trait, implement the `make(expr: E): A` method with your
 * analysis logic. The `make` method that takes the analysis node and
 * its arguments is provided for you and will construct the view E
 * before delegating to your implementation.
 *
 * @tparam E The view type provided by the Language.
 * @tparam A The result type of the analysis.

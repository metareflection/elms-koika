/**
 * An extractor that converts e-graph references (e-class calls) into surface language expressions.
 * Implementations define the extraction policy (e.g., cost-based or heuristic).
 *
 * Determinism depends on the extractor and the e-graph contents. If multiple trees are equally
 * optimal under the policy, the chosen tree may be implementation-defined.
 *
 * @tparam E The surface expression type stored in the e-graph and produced in the resulting expression.
 * @tparam Repr  The concrete e-graph type, which must implement both [[EGraphLike]] and [[EGraph]].

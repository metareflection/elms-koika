/**
 * Core parallelism abstraction in Foresight.
 *
 * `ParallelMap` defines a uniform interface for applying functions to collections,
 * supporting both sequential and parallel execution. It is the foundation for scalable
 * data processing and concurrent algorithms throughout the library.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *   - **Flexible execution**: Implementations may run tasks sequentially, in parallel,
 *     or with custom scheduling and resource usage.
 *   - **Hierarchical strategies**: Create named child strategies via [[child]],
 *     useful for subdividing work in complex algorithms.
 *   - **Cancellation support**: Wrap an existing strategy with [[cancelable]] to stop
 *     computation early when a [[CancellationToken]] is triggered.
 *   - **Performance measurement**: Use [[timed]] to obtain a [[TimedParallelMap]]
 *     for measuring execution times.
 *   - **Arbitrary task execution**: Run standalone computations with [[run]].
 *
 * ## Usage
 * {{{
 * val pm: ParallelMap = ParallelMap.parallel
 *
 * // Parallel mapping over a collection
 * val results = pm(Seq(1, 2, 3), (x: Int) => x * x)
 *
 * // With cancellation
 * val token = new CancellationToken
 * val cancelablePM = pm.cancelable(token)
 *
 * // Timed execution
 * val timedPM = pm.timed
 * }}}
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 * Implementations may differ in:
 *   - Degree of parallelism and thread scheduling
 *   - Overhead for small collections
 *   - Cancellation behavior (when checks are performed)
 *
 * @see [[ParallelMap.sequential]], [[ParallelMap.parallel]], [[ParallelMap.fixedThreadParallel]]

  /**
   * Returns a view of this strategy that cooperatively cancels work using the given token.
   *
   * Semantics:
   *   - If the token is canceled before work begins, no work is performed and an
   *     [[OperationCanceledException]] is thrown immediately.
   *   - While mapping, cancellation is observed at wrapper checkpoints (see below). When detected,
   *     an [[OperationCanceledException]] is thrown and remaining work is skipped.
   *
   * Checkpoints added by this wrapper:
   *   - One check before the mapping starts.
   *   - One check before processing each input element.
   *
   * Important:
   *   - The wrapper does not interrupt user code while running a single element function `f`.
   *     If `f` can run for a long time, pass the token into `f` and poll it inside `f`
   *     to achieve finer-grained cancellation.
   *
   * Example:
   * {{{
   * val token = new CancellationToken
   * token.cancelAfter(30.seconds)                 // common "set and forget" timeout
   *
   * val pm = ParallelMap.parallel.cancelable(token)
   * val out = pm(items, { a =>
   *   // Optional finer-grained check inside user code
   *   if (token.isCanceled) throw OperationCanceledException(token)
   *   compute(a)
   * })
   * }}}
   *
   * Composition:
   *   - Children created via [[child]] inherit cancellation by wrapping the parent's child.
   *   - Can be combined with [[timed]]; timing still reflects the work up to cancellation.
   *
   * @param token Cancellation trigger to observe.
   * @throws OperationCanceledException if the token is canceled before start or at any checkpoint.
   * @return A new [[ParallelMap]] that observes the token at the described checkpoints.

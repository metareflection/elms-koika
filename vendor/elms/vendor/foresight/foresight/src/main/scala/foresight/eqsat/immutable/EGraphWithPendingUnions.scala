/**
 * A lightweight wrapper around an e-graph that defers the application of union operations.
 *
 * Normally, applying a union in an e-graph requires invoking [[EGraph.unionMany(Seq[(EClassCall, EClassCall)], ParallelMap)]], which
 * merges the e-classes and triggers a rebuild. When many unions are expected—such as during
 * a rewrite pass—it is more efficient to defer them and apply them all at once.
 *
 * `EGraphWithPendingUnions` collects such deferred unions and lets you apply them in a batch
 * by calling [[rebuilt]] or [[rebuild]]. Internally, these methods delegate to [[EGraph.unionMany(Seq[(EClassCall, EClassCall)], ParallelMap)]],
 * ensuring that all unions are applied and the e-graph is fully rebuilt.
 *
 * You rarely need to construct this wrapper directly. Instead, you can call [[EGraph.union]],
 * which returns an `EGraphWithPendingUnions`, allowing fluent chaining:
 *
 * {{{
 * val updated = egraph
 *   .union(a, b)    // returns EGraphWithPendingUnions
 *   .union(c, d)    // chains further unions
 *   .rebuilt        // applies all pending unions and returns a rebuilt EGraph
 * }}}
 *
 * This is particularly useful in rewrite systems and equality saturation loops, where batching
 * union operations avoids excessive intermediate rebuilds and improves performance.
 *
 * @param egraph The underlying e-graph.
 * @param pending A list of deferred unions (pairs of e-class references).
 * @tparam NodeT The type of e-nodes stored in the e-graph.
 * @tparam Repr The concrete type of the underlying e-graph, which must support union and rebuild.

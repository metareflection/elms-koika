/**
 * A rewrite rule encapsulates a search-and-replace operation on an e-graph.
 *
 * A rule is parameterized by:
 *  - `NodeT`: The node type for expressions represented by the e-graph.
 *  - `MatchT`: The type of matches produced by this rule's search phase.
 *  - `EGraphT`: The type of e-graph this rule can be applied to. This must be a subtype of [[EGraph]].
 *
 * Rules support three main operations:
 *  - [[search]]: Find all matches of this rule in a given e-graph.
 *  - [[delayed]]: Build a staged command that applies all current matches when executed later.
 *  - [[apply]]/[[applyImmutable]]/[[tryApply]]: Search and apply all matches immediately, returning
 *    either the updated e-graph or a flag indicating whether any change occurred.
 *
 * The staged command produced by [[delayed]] can be batched with commands from other rules by
 * sharing a [[foresight.eqsat.commands.CommandScheduleBuilder]], allowing callers to
 * combine multiple rewrites into a single saturation step.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT   Node type for expressions represented by the e-graph.
 * @tparam MatchT  Type of matches produced by this rule's search phase.
 * @tparam EGraphT Type of e-graph this rule can be applied to. Must be a subtype of
 *                 [[EGraph]].

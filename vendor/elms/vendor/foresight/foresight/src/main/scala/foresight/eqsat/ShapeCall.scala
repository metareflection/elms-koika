/**
 * A canonicalized e-node paired with a renaming from its canonical slots back to the original slots.
 *
 * A shape is the name-independent normal form of an [[ENode]]: all slots that occur in the node are replaced
 * by numbered slots in lexicographic order (`$0`, `$1`, ...). The `renaming` then maps those canonical slots back
 * to the original (caller-context) slots so that applying it to `shape` reconstructs the original node.
 *
 * Typical construction is via `ENode.asShapeCall`, which guarantees that:
 *   - `shape` is in canonical slot form (all slots numeric, in order).
 *   - `renaming` maps each canonical numeric slot to the original slot it replaced.
 *
 * This decomposition underpins hash-consing and equality modulo renaming: equal-up-to-renaming nodes share
 * the same `shape` and differ only in the `renaming`.
 *
 * @param shape    The canonical e-node (slots are numeric and ordered).
 * @param renaming A map from the shape's numeric slots to the original slots. Applying it to `shape` yields the
 *                 original node.
 * @tparam NodeT   The domain-specific node type.
 * @example
 * {{{
 * // Start with a non-canonical node `n` that uses arbitrary slots:
 * val n: ENode[Op] = ...
 *
 * // Decompose into canonical shape and a renaming back to the original slots:
 * val sc: ShapeCall[Op] = n.asShapeCall
 *
 * // `sc.shape` has numeric slots (`$0`, `$1`, ...), and applying `sc.renaming` reconstructs `n`:
 * assert(sc.asNode == n)
 *
 * // To retarget the original slots to fresh ones:
 * val freshen = SlotMap.bijectionFromSetToFresh(sc.asNode.slotSet)
 * val scFresh = sc.rename(freshen)
 * val nFresh  = scFresh.asNode
 * }}}

/**
 * A trait representing a discrete probability distribution over non-negative integer indices.
 *
 * Implementations define how probability mass is assigned to integer values (e.g., based on
 * geometric decay or custom heuristics). This abstraction supports flexible priority-based
 * decision-making or sampling strategies.
 *
 * The primary method [[apply]] returns the probability associated with a given index.
 * It is expected that probabilities are non-negative and sum to at most 1 across all values
 * (though this is not enforced at the trait level).
 *
 * The helper method [[prioritiesToProbabilities]] enables assigning probabilities to arbitrary keys
 * based on a provided priority mapping. Keys with equal priorities are grouped and assigned the mean
 * probability of their position-based indices, derived from the distribution. The resulting
 * probabilities are then normalized to ensure they sum to exactly 1.
 *
 * Use this trait to model discrete ranking or selection scenarios, such as:
 *   - Weighted random choice among prioritized options
 *   - Probabilistic rule selection in equality saturation
 *   - Discrete softmax-like prioritization heuristics
 *
 * See also: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_probability_distribution Discrete probability distribution (Wikipedia)]]

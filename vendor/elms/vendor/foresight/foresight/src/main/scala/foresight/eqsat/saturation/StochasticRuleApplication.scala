/**
 * A saturation strategy that applies rewrite rules stochastically, based on user-defined priorities.
 *
 * This strategy repeatedly:
 *   1. Searches for matches of the given rewrite rules in the e-graph.
 *   2. Assigns priorities to each match using the provided [[foresight.eqsat.saturation.priorities.MatchPriorities]].
 *   3. Selects a batch of matches to apply, using weighted random sampling without replacement.
 *   4. Applies the selected matches using a configurable [[SearchAndApply]] strategy.
 *
 * This approach is useful when it's expensive or unnecessary to apply every match,
 * or when exploration is guided by domain-specific heuristics (e.g., rule priority, match cost).
 *
 * @example
 * To use this strategy without caching, you can create an instance like this:
 * {{{
 * val strategy = StochasticRuleApplication(
 *   rules = myRules,
 *   searchAndApply = SearchAndApply.immutable,
 *   priorities = MyCustomPriorities,
 *   random = Random(42)
 * )
 * }}}
 *
 * @param rules The set of rewrite rules to apply.
 * @param searchAndApply A search and apply strategy to find and apply rule matches.
 * @param priorities A prioritization mechanism for matches, including batch size selection.
 * @param random A random number generator used to sample matches based on priority.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT The type of e-graph nodes.
 * @tparam RuleT The type of rewrite rules.
 * @tparam EGraphT The type of e-graph, combining [[EGraphLike]] and [[EGraph]].
 * @tparam MatchT The type of matches returned by rules.

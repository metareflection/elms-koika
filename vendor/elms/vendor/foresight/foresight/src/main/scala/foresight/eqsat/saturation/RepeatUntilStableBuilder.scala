/**
 * A builder for creating a strategy that repeatedly applies a given `body` strategy until it reaches a stable state,

 * @param betweenIterations The strategy to be applied between iterations of `body`.
 * @tparam EGraphT The type of the e-graph that the strategies operate on, which must be a subtype of both [[EGraphLike]] and [[EGraph]].
 * @tparam DataT The type of data produced by the `body` strategy.
 * @tparam BetweenItersDataT The type of data produced by the `betweenIterations` strategy.

/**
 * A cost-annotated extraction tree together with a total slot renaming.
 *
 * This pairs an [[ExtractionTree]] with a [[SlotMap]] that must map every slot
 * appearing in the tree (`tree.slotSet`) to a (possibly different) slot. The
 * renaming encodes alpha-renaming needed to place the tree in a caller's context.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - `renaming` is total over `tree.slotSet` (checked by the constructor assertion).
 *   - Renaming preserves structure: only slot identities change, not shape, cost, size, or depth.
 *
 * Immutability:
 *   - Methods return new values; neither the tree nor the renaming are modified in place.
 *
 * @param tree     The underlying, immutable extraction tree.
 * @param renaming A total mapping for all slots in `tree`.
 * @tparam NodeT   Node/operator type.
 * @tparam C       Cost type.

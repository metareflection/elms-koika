/**
 * A generic, composable strategy for saturating an e-graph using rewrite rules.
 *
 * Strategies define the logic for applying one or more transformation steps to an [[foresight.eqsat.EGraph]],
 * potentially over multiple iterations. They are responsible for how rewrites are applied,
 * how progress is tracked, and how iteration is controlled (e.g., timeouts, fixpoints, or iteration limits).
 *
 * ## Design philosophy
 *
 * Strategies are:
 *   - **Modular** – They can be composed using `thenApply`, repeated with `repeatUntilStable`, or extended with
 *   features like logging, timeout, or metadata.
 *   - **Stateful** – Each strategy carries a custom `Data` payload that can track iteration-specific state across
 *   calls.
 *   - **Flexible** – They work with different e-graph wrappers like [[foresight.eqsat.metadata.EGraphWithMetadata]],
 *   [[EGraphWithRoot]], and [[EGraphWithRecordedApplications]] via extension methods.
 *
 * ## Key operations
 *
 *   - `apply` performs a single iteration of the strategy.
 *   - `initialData` provides the initial state for the strategy.
 *   - `thenApply`, `repeatUntilStable`, `withIterationLimit`, and `withTimeout` allow control-flow composition.
 *   - `withChangeLogger` allows inspection/debugging after each iteration.
 *
 * ## Usage example
 * {{{
 * val strategy: Strategy[Node, MyEGraph, MyState] =
 *   myRuleApplicationStrategy
 *     .withIterationLimit(10)
 *     .withTimeout(1.second)
 *     .repeatUntilStable
 * }}}
 *
 * ## Integration with e-graph wrappers
 *
 * The companion object defines implicit classes that lift strategies to:
 *   - e-graphs with metadata (`addAnalyses`, `closeMetadata`)
 *   - e-graphs with roots (`withRoot`, `closeRoot`)
 *   - strategies that rebase after each iteration (`thenRebase`)
 *   - strategies that record match applications (`closeRecording`)
 *
 * These allow higher-level behavior without modifying the core strategy.
 *
 * @tparam EGraphT The type of the e-graph being transformed (e.g., plain, rooted, or metadata-enriched).
 * @tparam Data The type of state carried by the strategy across iterations.

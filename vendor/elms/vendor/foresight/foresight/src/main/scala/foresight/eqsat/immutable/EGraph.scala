/**
 * An e-graph compactly represents many equivalent expressions at once by grouping structurally
 * compatible nodes into e-classes. This enables fast equality saturation and rewrite exploration
 * without duplicating common substructure.
 *
 * `EGraph` is a convenience alias of [[EGraphLike]] where the self type equals the trait itself:
 * `EGraph[NodeT]` extends `EGraphLike[NodeT, EGraph[NodeT]]`. Use this when you don’t need a custom
 * concrete e-graph subtype in your method signatures.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *   - **Immutable:** All mutating operations (add/union/etc.) return a new `EGraph[NodeT]`.
 *   - **Canonicalization:** Queries and updates are expressed in terms of canonical e-classes.
 *   - **Total API:** All core operations (query, add, union, find) are inherited from [[EGraphLike]].
 *
 * @tparam NodeT The domain-specific node type stored in e-nodes.
 * @example Typical usage
 * {{{
 * val g0: EGraph[MyNode] = EGraph.empty
 * val (c1, g1) = g0.add(ENode(Add, defs = SlotSet.empty, uses = SlotSet.empty, args = Seq(...)))
 * val (c2, g2) = g1.add(ENode(Mul, defs = ..., uses = ..., args = Seq(...)))
 * val g3 = g2.union(c1, c2).rebuilt
 * }}}

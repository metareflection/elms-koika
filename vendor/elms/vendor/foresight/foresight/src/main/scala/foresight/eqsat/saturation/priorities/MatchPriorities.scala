/**
 * Defines a strategy for prioritizing rule matches during stochastic rule application.
 *
 * This trait is used to guide the selection of which matches to apply in a given iteration
 * of a saturation loop, such as in [[foresight.eqsat.saturation.StochasticRuleApplication]].
 * It assigns a numeric priority to each match and determines how many to apply at once.
 *
 * Typical implementations might prioritize based on match cost, rule type, rule name,
 * or other domain-specific heuristics. This enables the system to explore the search space
 * more effectively or efficiently than by applying all matches or selecting them uniformly at random.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT The type of nodes in the e-graph.
 * @tparam RuleT The type of rewrite rules, which must produce matches of type `MatchT`.
 * @tparam EGraphT The type of e-graph to operate on.
 * @tparam MatchT The type of matches returned by applying a rule.

   *
   * The priority score is a non-negative `Double`, where higher values indicate more preferred matches.
   * These scores are used for weighted random sampling when selecting which matches to apply.
   * The specific method of prioritization is left to the implementation, which may consider

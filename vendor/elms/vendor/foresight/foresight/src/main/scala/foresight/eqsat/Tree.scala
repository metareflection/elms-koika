/**
 * An immutable, slot-aware, ordered tree representation of a term.
 *
 * Each node contains:
 *   - `nodeType`: The domain-specific operator or constructor at this position in the tree.
 *   - `definitions`: The slots bound by this node (e.g., local variables it introduces).
 *   - `uses`: The slots referenced by this node that are defined elsewhere in the tree.
 *   - `args`: A sequence of child subtrees.
 *
 * `Tree` is the structural (non-hash-consed) analogue to [[MixedTree]] and [[ENode]].
 * Unlike an e-graph, which merges equivalent subterms, a `Tree` retains explicit
 * duplication and hierarchy, making it suitable for parsing, printing, and intermediate
 * transformations prior to e-graph insertion.
 *
 * Slot information makes the `Tree` representation aware of variable binding and usage
 * sites, enabling correct handling of alpha-equivalence and scoping-sensitive rewrites.
 *
 * @param nodeType    The operator or constructor at this node.
 * @param definitions Slots bound/introduced by this node itself.
 * @param uses        Slots consumed by this node but defined elsewhere.
 * @param args        Ordered children of this node.
 * @tparam NodeT      The type used to represent operators/constructors.
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * // Construct a simple tree for: λx. x
 * val xSlot = Slot.fresh()
 * val body  = Tree("var", definitions = Seq.empty, uses = Seq(xSlot), args = Seq.empty)
 * val lam   = Tree("lambda", definitions = Seq(xSlot), uses = Seq.empty, args = Seq(body))
 *
 * assert(lam.definitions == Seq(xSlot))
 * assert(lam.args.head.uses.contains(xSlot))
 *
 * // Map over node types to produce a pretty-printed label:
 * val labeled = lam.map(op => s"<$op>")
 * }}}

/**
 * A strategy that performs a single maximal rewrite pass over a set of rules.
 *
 * For each rule in the given sequence, this strategy:
 *   1. Searches for **all matches** of that rule in the e-graph.
 *   2. Applies **every match** found, in one batch.
 *
 * This process is repeated once per strategy iteration. Importantly, this strategy does not independently
 * saturate to a fixpoint for each rule—it performs **only one pass** per rule per iteration.
 *
 * ## Characteristics
 *   - Exhaustive per-iteration application: all matches of all rules are applied.
 *   - No internal fixpointing per rule or across the e-graph.
 *   - Deterministic, non-prioritized, and non-stochastic.
 *   - Can be composed with [[Strategy.repeatUntilStable]] to run to convergence.
 *
 * ## Use cases
 *   - Baseline comparison against other selective or prioritized strategies.
 *   - Deterministic debugging and validation of rewrite rule behavior.
 *   - Scenarios where exhaustive coverage per iteration is preferred.
 *
 * ## Caution
 * This strategy may apply redundant or overlapping rewrites and can cause
 * rapid growth of the e-graph in large or densely connected rule sets.
 *
 * @param rules The rules to apply.
 * @param searchAndApply A strategy for rule search and application (may or may not cache matches).
 * @tparam NodeT   The type of nodes in the e-graph.
 * @tparam RuleT   The type of rules used.
 * @tparam EGraphT The e-graph implementation.
 * @tparam MatchT  The type of matches returned by rule search.

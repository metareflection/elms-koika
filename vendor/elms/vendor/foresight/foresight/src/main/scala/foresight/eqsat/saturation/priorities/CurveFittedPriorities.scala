/**
 * A match prioritization strategy that adjusts (reweights) priority scores using a fitted probability distribution.
 *
 * This class wraps an existing [[MatchPriorities]] instance and transforms its output priorities
 * via a user-supplied [[foresight.util.random.DiscreteDistribution]]. The distribution defines how to rescale or reshape
 * the priority values, for example to emphasize rare or high-value matches more strongly.
 *
 * This is useful in stochastic rule application settings where the raw priorities may not reflect
 * the desired sampling behavior—for instance, when encouraging exploration, controlling match diversity,
 * or enforcing soft caps on overly dominant matches.
 *
 * @example
 * To apply a geometric decay to the top-N matches:
 * {{{
 * val basePriorities = MyDomainPriorities
 * val decay = ShiftedGeometricDistribution(0.5)
 * val fitted = CurveFittedPriorities(basePriorities, decay)
 * }}}
 *
 * @param originalPriorities The base prioritization whose output will be reweighted.
 * @param distribution A discrete probability distribution used to convert raw priorities into normalized weights.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT The type of e-graph nodes.
 * @tparam RuleT The type of rules being applied.
 * @tparam EGraphT The type of e-graph to operate on.
 * @tparam MatchT The type of matches returned by the rules.

/**
 * Defines a dataflow-style analysis over an [[EGraph]].
 *
 * An analysis maps e-nodes to results of type `A`, combines results across
 * alternatives within an e-class via [[join]], and produces a metadata snapshot
 * that stays consistent with the e-graph.
 *
 * Implementations are expected to be pure: no in-place mutation of the analysis instance.
 *
 * ## Conceptual model
 *   - [[make]]: local transfer from a node and its argument results to a result `A`.
 *   - [[join]]: combine results that flow to the same e-class (e.g., from different nodes or paths).
 *   - [[rename]]: alpha-renaming utility to rewrite slot identifiers inside a result.
 *
 * The default [[apply]] method evaluates the analysis over the entire e-graph using a worklist:
 *   1. Seed with nodes that have **no arguments** (nullary) by calling [[make]].
 *   2. Propagate through dependent nodes until a fixed point is reached.
 *
 * ## Algebraic expectations for `join`
 * To behave like a least-upper-bound over a partial order, `join` is expected to satisfy:
 *   - **Associative**: `join(a, join(b, c)) == join(join(a, b), c)`
 *   - **Commutative**: `join(a, b) == join(b, a)`
 *   - **Idempotent**: `join(a, a) == a`
 *
 * While not enforced by the type system, violating these properties can prevent convergence
 * or yield order-dependent results.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT The IR node type carried by the e-graph's e-nodes.
 * @tparam A The analysis result type.

/**
 * An analysis that derives minimal-cost extraction results for each e-class.
 *
 * This analysis computes an [[ExtractionTreeCall]] at every e-class using a user-provided
 * [[CostFunction]] and implicit orderings. The resulting value encodes both the chosen
 * minimal-cost tree and the slot renaming needed to apply it in context.
 *
 * The cost domain `C` is totally ordered by the implicit `Ordering[C]`. When multiple candidates
 * have the same minimal cost, ties are broken deterministically using the implicit `Ordering[NodeT]`
 * via [[ExtractionTreeOrdering]].
 *
 * Immutability: Foresight e-graphs are immutable. Running this analysis does not mutate the input;
 * it produces results attached to the analysis view of the graph.
 *
 * @param name          Human-readable name for diagnostics and debugging.
 * @param cost          Node-local cost model used to score trees bottom-up.
 * @param costOrdering  (implicit) Total ordering over costs used to select minima.
 * @param nodeOrdering  (implicit) Tie-breaker over node types for deterministic selection.
 * @tparam NodeT        Node/operator type stored in the e-graph.
 * @tparam C            Cost type produced by the cost function.

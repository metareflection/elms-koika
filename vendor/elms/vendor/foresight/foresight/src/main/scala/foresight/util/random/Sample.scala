/**
 * Provides utility methods for random sampling, including weighted sampling algorithms.

  /**
   * Weighted random sampling without replacement using the Efraimidis–Spirakis algorithm.
   *
   * Each element is associated with a positive weight (priority), and the probability of an element being included in
   * the sample is proportional to its weight, adjusted over multiple draws without replacement.
   *
   * The algorithm works by generating a random key for each element using:
   *   key = pow(u, 1/w)
   * where u is a uniform random number in (0, 1), and w is the element's weight.
   * The N elements with the largest keys are selected.
   *

   *   Efraimidis, Pavlos S., and Paul G. Spirakis.

/**
 * Represents a rewrite rule as the composition of a [[Searcher]] and an [[Applier]].
 *
 * A rule has two primary components:
 *
 *  1. **Search** – uses a [[Searcher]] to discover all matches of the rule in a given [[EGraph]].
 *  2. **Apply** – for each match, uses an [[Applier]] to produce a [[CommandSchedule]] that mutates the e-graph
 *     (e.g., unions, insertions). Applications may be parallelized via [[ParallelMap]].
 *
 * After search and apply, a rule performs a **composition step**:
 *  - Command aggregation – all per-match commands are combined into a single, optimized
 *    [[foresight.eqsat.commands.CommandSchedule]] so they can be executed as one logical unit.
 *  - This aggregation deduplicates operations, removes no-ops, and preserves an execution order
 *    that is valid but not necessarily identical to the match order.
 *  - The result can be executed immediately (via [[apply]] / [[tryApply]]) or returned for later
 *    execution (via [[delayed]]).
 *
 * # When to use
 * - Use [[apply]] when you want to search-and-apply now, returning the (possibly) updated e-graph.
 * - Use [[tryApply]] when you want to know if *any* change happened, without creating a new object if none did.
 * - Use [[delayed(EGraphT, ParallelMap)]] when you want to stage the work and run it later,
 *   e.g., to batch multiple rules into a single saturation iteration.
 *
 * # Parallelism
 * Both searching and applying matches are parallelizable. The provided [[ParallelMap]] controls
 * concurrency and labeling of sub-tasks:
 *  - [[search]] uses `parallelize.child(s"match $name")`.
 *  - [[delayed(matches:*, *, *)]] uses `parallelize.child(s"apply $name")`.
 *
 * Implementations of [[Applier]] must be safe to execute concurrently over distinct matches of the same e-graph
 * snapshot. While the **order** of applications is not deterministic, rule appliers should be designed so that
 * observable semantics do not depend on application order.
 *
 * # Errors
 * If an error occurs while constructing or executing per-match commands, an
 * [[Rule.ApplicationException]] is thrown with context about the rule and e-graph.
 *
 * @tparam NodeT   Node payload type stored in the e-graph.
 * @tparam MatchT  Match object produced by the [[Searcher]] and consumed by the [[Applier]].
 * @tparam EGraphT Concrete e-graph type this rule targets. Must be both [[EGraphLike]] and [[EGraph]].
 * @param name      Human-readable rule name (used in logs/diagnostics).
 * @param searcher  Component responsible for finding matches (see [[Searcher.search]]).
 * @param applier   Component that turns a match into a [[CommandSchedule]] acting on the e-graph.
 * @example Defining and running a rule immediately
 * {{{
 * val constantFold: Rule[MyNode, MyMatch, MyEGraph] =
 *   Rule("const-fold", mySearcher, myApplier)
 *
 * // Runs search + apply now; returns updated e-graph (or the same instance if no changes).
 * val updated = constantFold(egraph)
 * }}}
 * @example Staging a rule and applying later (batching with other rules)
 * {{{
 * import foresight.eqsat.commands.CommandScheduleBuilder
 * import foresight.eqsat.parallel.ParallelMap
 *
 * // Batch two rules into a single command schedule using a shared builder
 * val builder = CommandScheduleBuilder.newConcurrentBuilder[MyNode]
 * r1.delayed(egraph, ParallelMap.default, builder) // stage first rule
 * r2.delayed(egraph, ParallelMap.default, builder) // stage second rule
 * val batched = builder.result()
 *
 * // Somewhere later in the saturation loop:
 * val next = batched.applyImmutable(egraph, ParallelMap.default).getOrElse(egraph)
 * }}}

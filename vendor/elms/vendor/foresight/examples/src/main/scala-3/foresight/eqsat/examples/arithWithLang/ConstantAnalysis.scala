/**
 * This analysis tries to compute a compile-time constant for each node in the
 * arithmetic-with-lang example. It is intentionally minimal and pedagogical:
 * we keep the lattice as `Option[BigInt]` and only propagate through
 * `Number`, `Add`, and `Mul`.
 *
 * Because we extend [[foresight.eqsat.lang.LanguageAnalysis LanguageAnalysis]] with
 * the surface type `ArithExpr`, `make` receives *decoded* AST nodes (not e-graph
 * tuples). That keeps the implementation idiomatic Scala pattern matching.
 *
 * ## Child-facts invariant
 * When `make` is called on a node, its **immediate children are already wrapped as
 * `Fact[A]`** where `A = Option[BigInt]` for this analysis. In other words, the
 * sub-results of the analysis have been placed into the tree before your case
 * analysis runs. This means pattern matches can look directly for
 * `Fact(Some(v))` on the children. The parent node itself (the `expr` you match on)
 * remains the normal surface constructor (e.g., `Add(lhs, rhs)`).
 *
 * ## How this plugs into the example
 *   - The companion of [[ArithExpr]] provides an [[foresight.eqsat.lang.AnalysisBox AnalysisBox]]
 *     using `Fact[A]`.
 *   - In `make`, we specifically match on `Fact(Some(v))` subtrees: this leverages the
 *     child-facts invariant described above.
 *   - Tests wire this analysis alongside `ExtractionAnalysis.smallest` to enable rules
 *     that consult constants mid-rewrite.
